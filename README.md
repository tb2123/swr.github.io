- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tushar N. Bhatt and doing Space Weather Research (SWR). 
The research is important to know how our neighbour planets behave comparitively to Earth. 
I am considering spacecrafts and its observations which are organised by NASA, USA.
To carry out my research work, special help is providing by Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), UK and from my guide Prof. Rajmal D. jain (support from RAS).
I also trained by CCMC center, a part of modelling center, NASA, USA.
I have also experience in Material Science (PVD & Sputtering) with R&D experiments (Silver Cell, Ceramics & Magnetic Thrusters) and characterizations.
In addition of these, I also worked as lecturer, proofreader, translator and Quality Control Chemist (Pharma).
I am crazy to do and learn new things and so I am also trying to develop my computer coding skills and try to achieve goals for Front-end, Back-end and Full-stack developer programmes.
