    ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tushar N. Bhatt and doing Space Weather Research (SWR). The research is important to know how our neighbour planets behave comparitively to Earth. The study will help us to fulfill our curiosity about Earth's past, Present and Future in the space for human being survival purpose.

    I am considering spacecrafts and its observations which are organised by NASA, USA.
    The special help is providing by Prof. Andrew J. Coates (PI of Electron spectrometer-ELS), Prof. Dhiren Kataria of Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL),University College London (UCL),UK and from my First Supervisor Prof. Rajmal D. jain (support from RAS). Right now, i am not getting fund for research.

    I also trained by CCMC modelling center, NASA, USA.
    
    I have also experience in Material Science (PVD & Sputtering) with R&D experiments (Silver Cell, Ceramics & Magnetic Thrusters) and characterizations from Institute for Plasma, India.

    In addition of these, I also worked as lecturer, proofreader, translator and Quality Control Chemist (Pharma).

    I am crazy to do and learn new things and so I am also trying to develop my computer coding skills and try to achieve goals for Front-end, Back-end and Full-stack developer programmes.
