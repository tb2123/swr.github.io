I am Tushar N. Bhatt and doing Space Weather Research (SWR) data analysis for PhD work. The research is important to know how our neighbouring planets behave comparitively to Earth when influenced by solar transients i.e. coronal mass ejections, corotating interaction regions. The study will help us to fulfill our curiosity about Earth's Past, Present and Future in the space for human beings survival purpose.

For my research work, I am considering various spacecrafts observations with CCMC models which are organised by NASA, USA.

The special help to carry out these research work is providing by Prof. Andrew J. Coates (PI of Electron spectrometer(ELS) of Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS), CASSINI Mission), Prof. Dhiren Kataria and Dr. Paul Prior of Computer Coding Center of Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), University College London (UCL), UK and from my First Supervisor Prof. Rajmal D. Jain (Retired PRL Scientist, PI of SOXS Mission & RAS Fellow).
 
In addition of all of above, I am an experienced person for R&D in Material Science with various task like nanoparticle development by Physical Vapor Deposition (Magnetron Sputtering) of Silver for Solar Cell development, Physical Vapor deposition of Carbon, Ion Beam Sputtering for Ceramics & Magnetic Thrusters Hysteresis checking, On hand experience of FE-HRSEM and Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy Characterizations (Any material), Diffusion Pump maintanance, Magnetron maintanance, Vacuum Chamber leak test, etc from Institute for Plasma Research, India under the supervision of Dr. Mukesh Ranjan, Scientific Officer-G, IPR India (An autonomous unit of Dept. of Atomic Energy). I have also little experience with Xray diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Micrscopy (AFM), Contact Angle Measurement, Fourier transfrom Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman Spectroscopy.

In addition of these, I also worked as a Lecturer, Quality Control Chemist (Pharma), Translator and Proofreader.

I am crazy to do and learn new things and so I am also trying to develop my computer coding skill and try to achieve goals for Front-end, Back-end and Full-stack developer skills. For these, right now, I am using VScode, html, CSS and github. After getting satisfactory skill, I am in plan to include javascript, php and python. Then, I will see what other new things I can do with these.

I am interested and ready to work for Physical Vapor Deposition, Instrumentation with maintanance, Operation of Characterization Instruments and Solar Physics & Space Weather Research data analysis. I am also ready for online work like Programming, Website & logo design, Translation (English-Hindi-Gujarati), Proof reading (Maths, Science, Physics), Coaching of Maths, Physics, Electronics subject, Coding, etc.
